# hopen

> **⚠️ Early Development:** This project is in active development. Features, documentation, and implementation details are subject to change.

A self-hosted headless CMS with runtime schema definition. No repos, no rebuilds - just pull the container and start creating content.

## Why hopen?

Traditional headless CMS solutions like Strapi or Sanity require you to:
- Set up a new repository for each project
- Define schemas in code and rebuild
- Deal with complex containerization
- Pay for cloud hosting or manage complicated self-hosting

**hopen changes this:**
- 🚀 Zero-config setup - pull the Docker image and run
- ⚡ Define content types dynamically via UI/API without restarts
- 🐳 Container-native from day one
- 🔓 Self-hosting first - your data, your infrastructure

## Planned Features

> **Note:** Feature list and priorities are subject to change during development.

- Dynamic content type definition
- Text and Markdown support
- Media management (images, videos, files)
- Multi-language support
- User management and role-based access
- RESTful API
- GraphQL API (planned)
- Content versioning (planned)
- Webhooks (planned)

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: .NET 10
